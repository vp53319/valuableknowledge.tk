Stress severe prolonged stress can actually kill neurons and literally cause damage to your brain. We all have a built-in reflex called the flight or fight reflex. It gets turned on when we're under stress. And it was originally designed to help us survive short term unexpected events like getting eaten by a tiger. The problem is that in today's world the stress response gets turned on and in many of us it stays on in stressful situations we release a chemical called cortisol and in the short term it gives us a quick burst of energy for survival reasons. Heightened memory functions lower sensitivity to pain a burst of increased immunity and helps maintain a homeostasis in our body. However prolonged exposure to high doses of cortisol can be very damaging and lead to things like impaired cognitive performance blood sugar imbalances like hyperglycemia decreased bone density increase in muscle mass high blood pressure lowered immunity and inflammatory responses in the body slower wound healing and increased abdominal fat. Yuck!

Some stress warning signs include distractibility, loss of focus and concentration, irritability, tension in the body and muscles, avoidance and procrastination, exhaustion and fatigue, loss of self-confidence, decreased self-esteem, sadness, low mood and even depression. Stress can be a real issue for many students. So, what can we do about it?

Step 1 get regular exercise. Even something as simple as taking a 20-minute walk can help. Excercise such as workout or tennis two to three times a week and it really helped. Exercise has a huge impact on stress and mental well-being. 

Step 2 get some sleep. Make sure you're getting enough sleep and don't forget about cat naps in the afternoon. 

Step 3 watch your breathing. Don't forget to breathe when you're stressed out. You'll actually notice that your breathing becomes more frequent and your breaths become shallower when you notice this try to take longer deeper breaths. If you want to take things a bit further has a look at meditation or the 7-11 breathing technique.

Step 4 check your perspective. It's usually never as bad as you think it is. I tended to think it was the end of the world if I did bad on a test or assignment. Well guess what it wasn't. Learn from your mistakes and keep moving forward.

Step 5 learn muscle relaxation tensing and relaxing the different muscles in your body one at a time can really help reduce tension. There are quite a few really good relaxation apps that you can get for your mobile phone. So, check them out.

Step 6 engage in some guilt free play. Sometimes we just need to get out and have some fun. My roommates and I once wrote a couch down a toboggan to hill and right into a tree. In retrospect it was pretty stupid but man was it fun.

Step 7 try to reduce loneliness and isolation whether you live on or off campus. Try and see what you can do about getting involved. Most schools have dozens and dozens of clubâ€™s events organizations and other things that you can join.  So do some digging and see what you can come up with.

Step 8 learn to manage your time.  A big part of feeling stressed out in university is feeling pressed for time. My time management skills coming at a high school were pretty bad. So, start keeping track of your time and learn to use it more effectively.

Step 9 learn to get organized. One of the best ways you can get organized is to do up a schedule for yourself and all the things that you need to do on a daily weekly and monthly basis. By knowing what things, you need to do each day and when things are due, you'll keep your stress levels down. Try it out.
