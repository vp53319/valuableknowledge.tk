For this exercise we will plot the stars in the constellation Orion both by hands and then in Colabs using matplotlib. Read "Lab-StarsInOrion.pdf".  (You can find it in our lab package by clicking on the link under Syllabus.)  Create a diagram for the stars in Orion, just the  PRESENT. Do this by hand using the chart in the lab.  Take picture and insert it to your Colab notebook and/or submit the picture directly to Canvas.

Next you need to plot the same stars in Orion in Google Colabs using matplotlib. Watch and this tutorial on matplotlib:

You can follow the example below to plot Stars in Orion in Colab or Jupyter notebook: 

[Plot of Stars in Canis Major in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tb7dNC3LtY0OoqBACqyMORt55tV8fMJI?usp=sharing)

You need to convert RA  real number. For example,  5hr 54min = 5 + (54/60) = 5.9hr. RA = x, and DEC = y. Notice you have to invert the RA. This is because the RA starts high then goes lower. 

 
Watch the same "Python Essential" and do a ~ 1  page summary on Sections 5, 6

Finally answer this math question (2 points): if a radio wave has a frequency of 100*10^6 Hz, what is it wavelength?
Remember the wavelength and frequency inverse relationship for light.

Submit these to Canvas. You should have three items: (1) Stars in Orion graph by hand. (2) Stars in Orion plot using matplotlib. (3) Answer to math question.
