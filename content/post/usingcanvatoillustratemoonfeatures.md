Canva is a graphic design platform that allows users to create social media graphics, presentations, posters and other visual content. It is available on web and mobile, and integrates millions of images, fonts, templates and illustrations. It has a free tier that you can subscribe with your Google or Facebook account. The free tier for many of us is more than good enough.

Watch this video tutorial or other video tutorials about Canva of your preference.

This will lead you to a page where you can signup with either Facebook or Google account. Once signin, there will be a popup that asks what do you plan to use Canva for? You can choose Student, Personal, or other options. I chose Personal, and it give me this screen:

Use the scrollbar to go all the way to the end. Pick "Custom dimensions" option. Create a design of 2000 x 2000 px. Alternatively
you can also choose Create a design -> "Custom dimensions" from the left navigation bar.

Change the background color of the canvas to black.

Save the Moon picture below then upload it to Canva. Move the Moon picture around and center it. There are guides to snap the picture to the center.

Click on Elements on the left navigation bar and search for arrow or arrows. Pick an arrow style that you like and drag it to your
picture.

![canva signup page](/img/canva08.jpg)

You can rotate, move, resize, and change the color of the arrow. Move the arrow to Kepler crater like below.

![canva signup page](/img/canva09.jpg)

Next click on Text of the left navigation bar and add a subheading or choose a font design of your preference.
Rename this to Kepler (crater). Then resize and reposition it next to the arrow. You can change the font size and color if you like.

Next look at this Moon image below. Repeat the process so that on your Moon design, you should have 6 Mares (blue color) and 6
Craters (gold color).

Now we factually know that the Apollo astronauts did landed on the Moon! The picture below proves it :smiley: . For this assignment also diagram the Apollo landing sites below into your Moon design. Just the name and arrow is good enough. For example, Apollo 11 -->

![Apollo Moon Landing Sites](/img/Apollo-moon-template-with_ST.jpg)

So your Moon design should have 6 mares, 6 craters, 6 Apollo landing sites, 1 lowland, 1 highland. You can download your image here

For the next part of our lab, create a greeting card with the title "Shoot for the Moon. Even If You Miss, You'll Land Among the Stars." Be creative and have fun with your design! If you choose a premium font or elements there will be
the Canva watermark on your greeting card. But for this class that should be OK.

For the final part of our lab answer this math question below. It's worth 2 points: The angular diameter of the Moon is 0.5 degree. 
How many minutes does it takes for the Moon to move this far? Remember the Moon orbital period, the time that it takes to go 360 degree,
is 27.3 days.

The process to submit is similar to the [Length of Sidereal Day lab](../lengthofsiderealday). Use Google Colab, but this time name the notebook as lab07.
