For this exercise, you will create a blog either in Google Blogger or Wordpress.com. You will write and put up two posts. The posts should have pictures and links to video. Link to video is better if it's embedded. The first post should be about an astronomy topic. You can use the same content when you did your astronomy video assignment. The second post is to write a 1 page summary of "Python Essential Training" sections 9 & 11.

You can view the tutorial for how to create a blog here. One of the video on Blogger is long. You can either skim it or search for another tutorial on Youtube. Many of us already have a Google account, so you do not need to create another account if you use Blogger.
