This exercise is located in Canvas. Goto Syllabus. Click the link and download the zip file. Unzip, open and Read "VisualObservationOfTheMoon.pdf". Then observe and draw the moon phases for 5 nights. Approximate the % of the Moon illuminated. The whole Moon is the area of the circle. What % of that area is lit?  For this lab it does not have to be 5 consecutive nights or the same time. It can be any five nights. But make sure you record the date and time of your observation. You also need to record the azimuth and altitude of the Moon at the time of your observation. This is because these information would let me credit your work correctly. Below is the worksheet for this exercise:

Below is a reminder of azimuth and altitude. Face North at Polaris, and the azimuth for that is 0 degree. 

[Altitude Azimuth Coordinate System - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system)

You can print out the pdf page, draw moon phases and record date and coordinate by hands, take picture of that, and turn it in. However to get full credit, use apps to draw/paint the moon phases and edit date & time, azimuth & altitude. You can use apps like Canva, Photoshop, Gimp, Pixlr, Google Draw... For example you can use Canva to create a canvas. On the canvas create a circle and underneath 2 lines title "Date & Time" and "Az & Alt". Copy and paste this 4 more times, and you have created a page similar to the one in "VisualObservationOfTheMoon.pdf". 


Below are links to some suggested apps:

Here is an example of doing this exercise using canva. Notice that this lab did not include the azimuth and altitude of the Moon at the time of observation.

For the next part of this exercise, you will watch and write a summary on python video tuorial. If you do not have a LA public library card yet, go here to sign up for an ecard:  [https://www.lapl.org/about-lapl/contact-us/e-card/e-card-registration](https://www.lapl.org/about-lapl/contact-us/e-card/e-card-registration) . You need this to access Lynda.com . With the ecard you will

- log into [https://www.lynda.com/portal/sip?org=lapl.org](https://www.lynda.com/portal/sip?org=lapl.org) 
- Click and goto the course [Python Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Python-Essential-Training/614299-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3apython+essential%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2)

- Watch Chapters 2 -4 and write a 2 pages double spaced review.

 

Finally do this math problem (2 points): When Neptune and Uranus are closet to each other, what is the gravitational force between them? Show your work. The gravitational constant G = 6.67408 Ã— 10-11 N*m2 / s-2  . We did a similar gravity activity  in lab 2

Submit through Canvas as attachments. For this lab you should  have three items: (1) moon phases picture, (2) the python summary, and (3) Uranus Neptune gravity math. For the summary and math problem you can submit with Jupyter notebook .ipynb, Google Colab, MS Word, or Adobe acrobat pdf.  For those using Mac make sure you submit in those formats. This is because I am using Windows and cannot open Mac files.
