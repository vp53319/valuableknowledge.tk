In this exercise we will plot the distant versus recessional velocity of galaxies using matplotlib. Then we will use linear regression or least square fit method to determine the slope of the line, which is also the Hubble's constant. We can then use inverse this constant to calculate the age of the universe. Read the lab "Lab-HubbleConstant.pdf" . We will only do from 1 through 4, finding the age of the Universe in year.

Check out my google colab below:

I already found the Hubble's constant and the age of the Universe. However the data set is old, so my age of the universe is not as accurate. Look at the image below and also the same in Colab, I post an updated data set. Use this data set, follow my procedure, find the Hubble's constant, and calculate the age of the Universe. Maybe your answer will be better!

Finally answer this math question (2 points): The Hubble constant can tell us  how fast 1 Mpc is expanding (i.e, it expands at a rate of 70 km/s). How long does it take at this rate for 1 Mpc to expand to 2 Mpc?
