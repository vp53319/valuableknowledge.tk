After an autopsy with patients who positive the COVID-19 virus, this is the expert s' observation:

COVID-19 carries thick phlegm and this is what breaks the air passage in our breathing. This phlegm and easily dries, hardens and blows on airways (air tunnel) and capillaries (lungs) that cause patient breathing harder. They learned that to treat it, barred "airways" must be opened for medicine to enter, but it's not easy to do. Counting down the day before this happens.

Before reaching this situation, the following is their recommendation that we can make in our homes:

#1 Drink plenty of hot liquids or drinks, such as coffee, broth, tea, and hot water. It's good to drink every 20 minutes to keep your throat wet, and this way the virus goes into the stomach and there is a possibility that virus dies with the help of gastric juices and acid in our stomach.

#2 Gargle (mouthwash) an antiseptic mouthwash (such as Listerine, etc. ), or without mix of salt, vinegar or calamansi the warm water. Do this every day. Better do this with your kids.

#3 The virus can stick and live in hair and clothing. It can be killed by soap but if you're from outside fine don't sit and handle things when you get home. Go straight to the bath. If you can't wash every day, it's better to fold clothes in the sun and it will also help kill the virus.

#4 Cleanse steel items because the virus remains in "metallic surfaces" for up to 9 days. Be mindful of handling railings (in escalator, elevator, desk, door knobs, switches, faucet, sink, refrigerator, keys, locks, cell phone, gadgets, etc. ) These are better to be disinfected even with your items inside your home.

#5 Don't smoke.

#6 Practice washing your hands every 20 seconds. Hand washing should also last 20 minutes using any foaming soap. It's better if antibacterial or disinfecting soap.

#7 Eat fruits and vegetables. Not just the level of Vit. C and good increase if not even Zinc in our body.

#8 Animal cannot pass COVID-19 virus to human, it is typically human-to-human. (But it seems to be nice to be careful.)

#9 Avoid having 'flu' (flu) because it itself weakens defenses, and avoid cold foods and drinks.

#10 If a little bit feels bad in the throat like sore throat, or its initial symptoms (such as if it seems to gather or cough), fight it immediately through the above mentioned. Throat is the first virus attack and takes 3 to 4 days before it goes into the capillaries (lungs).

Take care of yourself and pass this information on. Hope it helps everyone :-)!
