In this week lab, you will be producing a video slideshow then upload it to Youtube. You then copy and paste the youtube link to your video and submit that to Canvas. The topic I chose is the Sun, but you can choose any astronomy topic of your interest. For example, you can choose to do a video slideshow about blackhole. The video length should be around 1:30 - 2 minutes. The video should have about 10 slides with 1 blackhole fact per slide. So the duration is about 10 seconds per slide. There should be transition between each slide. This will make it easier to watch because the scene does not jump abruptly from one to the next. 

For the video editing process, we can use (1) Shortcut, (2) Shorcut in combination with Lumen5, or your own preference. You can decide which workflow is best for you. Shorcut is an open source free video editor available for both Windows and macOS. Lumen5 is a online video editing platform. You need to subcribe to the Lumen5 free tier. With the free account they will give you 5 video projects to publish per month, which is good enough for our purpose. The Lumen5 video does not allow you to do your voice over and it will have Lumen5 credit attach to the end of the video. We can get around this by import Lumen5 video into Shotcut, add audio voice over, and cutoff the Lumen5 end credit. Using a combination of Lumen5 and Shotcut achieve very good result.

Below are two video slideshow examples I made. The first one is with Shotcut only. The second one I used Lumen5 to work on the visual presentation. Then I download it to my PC. Next I import that video into Shortcut to work on background music and voice over. 

The Notice how I have a pretty good english accent in the videos :smiley:! I will show us how to use ai text-to-speech to generate the voice over. Of course you can also record your voice and do your own voice over. It's actually better that way and build up your confident too! You can submit your video slideshow without the voice over. However it won't get full credit to be fair to everyone.

Now let's take a look at how to do voice over. Obviously the most direct way to record our voice and import that into Shortcu. Another method is to use ai text-to-speech technology. For example, I want to generate a voice over for "The Sun Accounts for 99.86% of the Mass in the Solar System" fact. I do this by going to the IBM text-to-speech demo 
([Click here to go to IBM text-to-speech](https://text-to-speech-demo.ng.bluemix.net/?_ga=2.149277174.1746788865.1577973300-883782623.1576869895&cm_mc_uid=15278110739115689857415&cm_mc_sid_50200000=20950731577973297095&cm_mc_sid_52640000=33641591577973297117))
, and follow the procedure below:

![IBM text to speech demo](/img/ibm-text-to-speech-demo-03.jpg)

1. Choose the voice of your preference.
2. Click on the SSML tab, Type in the text, and click speak.
3. Click on the "Speak" icon to generate the voice over
4. Right click on the play bar and  click "Save audio as..." 

Save your file in .mp3 format, for example I saved mine as scene1.mp3. In the SSML tab, < p > means paragraph. < s > means sentence. < prosody rate > means faster or slower. -7% means speak 7% slower than normal. < break time > means delay between words. Play around with the options to see which one you like best. After this you can upload these mp3 files to Shotcut to work on your video.

As I mentioned earlier, Shotcut is open source and free to download for both Windows and MacOS. You can download and install Shotcut here:

[Click here to download Shotcut](https://www.shotcut.org/download). Most of us now are either on Windows 64-bit or macOS.

We begin by opening Shortcut and Go to File -> New to create a project in Shotcut by giving it a name. Then we drag the images, videos, audio mp3 into to the playlist and time line. Notice you can add images to your project. If you want the image to be 10 seconds long for example, then just drag the image into the timeline and extend it to 10 seocnds.

1. Drag to import files into Shotcut
2. Drag and drop files into timeline to edit
3. Mute the sound on the track if you want

![Shotcut Panel](/img/shotcut03.jpg)

You can add an audio or video track by

1. Clicking on the timeline icon to Add Audio Track or Add Video Track
2. The magnetic snap let you snap the video clips side by side more easily

Here is the entire view of my Shorcut working panel that produced the first video in this article. It has one video track with transition effects, one voice over audio track, and one background music audio track. I lowered the volume in the background audio track following the audio tutorial posted earlier.

To produce the video click on File, choose Export, then choose Youtube

You can then go to the Jobs panel, right click and Show In Folder to view the finish video!

Here is a short tutorial on Lumen5.

Lumen5 is intuitive to use. Create a list of 1 title + 10 facts on your subject. Make sure to have space between each fact. Cut and Paste the text into Lumen5. It will automatically generate a sequence of video scences for you. It is not perfect, so you will need to edit the scense for better fit. Here is an example of my Lumen5 workflow:

**Notice**: ignore this part below about InVideo. It looks promising, but when I tried to download the video it kept giving me errors. I will update this part when InVideo fixes this bug....

InVideo is a cloud based video editing software that you can access it through the internet with your browser. Watch the tutorial below if you plan to use InVideo. They have a free plan that includes watermark in the video. It should be OK for our purpose, although I have trouble export and download the my video in InVideo.

Once I signed in, I click on categories and choose Slide Show. Of course you can experiment with other categories. Next, there are several template you can choose. Make sure to consider the aspect ratio. The 16:9 format is wide screen for youtube videos on TV, laptop, PC, etc. On the other hand, the 9:16 vertical aspect ratio is for mobile phone. Some apps like TikTok work best with 9:16 vertical format. I chose 16:9 wide Quick Fsacts template.
