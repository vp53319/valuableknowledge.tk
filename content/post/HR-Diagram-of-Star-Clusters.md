In this exercise we will plot 3 HR diagrams of 3 star clusters. From the graphs we will be able to answer these three questions: (1) Rank the cluster from youngest to oldest, (2) Rank the cluster from closest to farthest, and (3) for each cluster, count/classify how many stars are main sequence, giant, and white dwarf. See below for the data to graph:

Read the lab "lab-HRDiagram.pdf". You can find this in our lab package under "Syllabus". Basically you need to plot the HR-Diagram for three clusters and answers the three questions above. You can plotting these three clusters by hand using this graph:

However plotting using Jupyter/Colab notebook will earn more credit. See Colab guidance below:

Next Watch Python Essential Training section and write a ~ 1 page review on sections 7 & 8 .

Finally answer this math question (2 points) : We observed the light from the start with wavelength 位'  = 656 nm. We know that in our lab this light has a wavelength of 位o = 656.3 nm. Find the velocity of the star using the formula for Doppler shift of light  in term of wavelength. See the formula in the link below

[Link to formula](https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/features/yba/M31_velocity/spectrum/doppler_more.htm)
 

位' (light we see from star)  = 656 nm

位o (same light we see from lab) = 656.3 nm

Co = speed of light = 3.0*10^8 m/s

Is the start moving toward or away from us?
